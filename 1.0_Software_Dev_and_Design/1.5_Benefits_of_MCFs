Benefits of functions, classes, and modules

- First, Modules include Classes which include functions

benefits
- Makes testing easier
- improves readability
- eliminates redundancies
- Modularity (ability to reuse the code for other things)

Things to be aware of:
- avoid cyclic dependencies where two module rely on eachother for something
- You want modules and classes to have loose coupling
  - Modules, classes and functions should have as few dependencies on other MCFs as possible
  - 3 parameters to measure this: size (# of relations), visibilty (passing variables in simple way), flexibilty
- You want to have as strong of cohesion as possible meaning that each MCF has its own clearly defined purpose
