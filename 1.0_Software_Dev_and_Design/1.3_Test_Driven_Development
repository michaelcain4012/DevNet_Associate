Descibe the concepts of test-driven Development

Benefits:
1. Ensures all code has automated tests by using the test-first approach
2. Ensures all use cases are tested

The process:
1. Write Tests
2. Run the tests; they must fail
3. Write source code
4. Run all tests; they must pass
5. Refactor code where necessary

Benefits of refactoring code:
1. Better code structure: you may find redundancies
2. Better code readability
3. Better Design: improved performance or simplification
