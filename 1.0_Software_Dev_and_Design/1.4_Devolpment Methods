Comparing Agile, Lean, and Waterfall



Agile
- Utilizes short sprints where goal is to development a functional piece of the product
- includes customers in the development lifecycle
- Encourages feedback early on
- Very open to changes in requirements
- Scrum is the most popular agile methodology
- Tasks move from product backlog to sprint backlog
- Each sprint: analysis->Design->Code->Test

Pros
- Rapid and continuos delivery
- people interaction is emphasized
- late project changes are welcome

Cons
- Less emphasis on good documentation
- Customer requirements may be unclear at the beginning
- Major design changes may occur during the cycle



Waterfall
- Linear and sequential approach to Development
- Phases: requirements/analysis->design->coding->Testing->Maintenance
- Limits the possibility to freely move between project phases (have to complete one phase before moving onto the next)
- you are forced to complete a phase before moving forward, with no possibility of going back
- If anything changes you must go back to the analysis phase and begin again.
- Testing is left till the end during crunch time (tendency for people to skip out on crucial tests)

Pros
- Design errors highlighted before any code is written
- Good documentation is mandatory
- Easy to measure progress and set milestones

Cons
- In early stages it can be difficult to gather all requirements
- inflexible
- No testing until full product is complete


Lean
- this is more of a concept rather than a methodology
- if you don't need it, get rid of it
- 3 major points to fully embrace lean
  - Purpose
  - process
  - People
