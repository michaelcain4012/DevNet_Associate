Benefits of common design patterns


Observer
- Publisher alerts the observer anytime there is a state change
- think of this as getting an email every time there is a sale (you are the observer)
-


MVC (Model-View-Controller)
- View responds to user input. Typically the front end
- Controller reads input from the view and translates it to the model
- Controller handles all of the logic (ie validating input)
- Model is where the data is stored (could be a database)

Benefits of MVC:
- Separation of concern
- Multiple views of the same model
- independent testing of components
- pluggable components

Cons of MVC:
- Increased complexity
- excessing number of change notification
- view and controller are tightly coupled
