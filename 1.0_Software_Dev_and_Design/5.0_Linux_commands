Linux file  permissions

Handles permissions with 2 factors
 1. Who - Users, groups or other
 2. What - Read (4), Write(2), or execute(1) or nothing(0)
 - give users these numbers to assign their permission level
 - Each set of -'s represent a group
 - ie -rw-r--r-- users (us) have read write, groups has read, and Other has read

chmod {value} {filename} - used to change permissions on a file
  - ie chmod 755 basic.txt changes permisions to -rwxr-xr-x which means users = read,write,execute groups,other = read, execute
