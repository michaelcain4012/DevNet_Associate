Benefits of Edge Computing


Edge computing is a distributed network architecture that moves your compute, storage, comms, control and decision making closer to the network edge or where end users are

Use cases:
1. Bandwidth reduction
2. Filtering: Filter only relevant traffic toward your main network
3. Latency optimization
4: Partitioning: Balance and allocate resources across the network
5. Simplified apps
6. Dynamic Changes: data can be redirected based on content and priority
7. Analytic support: Data can be used for analytics and higher-level systems
8. Network efficiency


Disadvantages:
1. Operationally complex due to number of sites
2. Expensive due to resources for each site
3. Distribution of security and knowledge

Pros:
1. Speed/Latency
2. Privacy - your traffic exists in fewer places
3. Resiliency - If one location goes down, still have more
4. Scalability - add more nodes easily
5. Better network efficiency
6. Reducing transport costs
