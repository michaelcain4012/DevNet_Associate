Firewalls, DNS, Load Balancers, and reverse proxy in app deployment


Firewalls
- Block filter and monitor HTTP reqs to and from a web app
- WAF operates on L3 to L7 instead of just L3 and L4 like a normal firewall
- Does not ensure safe traffic, no protocol inspection, SSL traffic inspection, or any other kind of threat detection.
- Prevents DDoS and SQL injections

Reverse proxy
- Reverse proxy server resembles traditional server that fwds requests to a traditional server
- SSL encryption is usually done on the reverse proxy
- Can operate as a load balancer
- Protects against attacks ont he OS and the webserver

Load Balancing
- optimizes resources, minimizes response time and helps avoid overload
- Load balanced system can consist of databases, web pages, FTP sites, and DNS servers
- Different approaches:
  - Round Robin: selects servers in turns
  - least connections: selects server with least number of connections
  - Source algorithms: Looks at users IP and makes sure it connects to the same server
  - Sticky sessions: Same user connects to the same web sercer when web apps demand so (prevents user from being pushed to new server if that one gets overloaded)


DNS
- Convert hostnames to IP's
-
