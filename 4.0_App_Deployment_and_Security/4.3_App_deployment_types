Application Deployment Types

Most deployments today are in some sort of virtual environment

Bare-metal
- Refers to the physical computer components
- Advantages
  1. Performance: Physical server resources can be optimized for workload
  2. Security
  3. Reliability


Virtual Machines
- Emulation of a computer system running on a shared host
- Each VM has its own OS, libs, and apps
- It is not aware of the other VM's on the host
- Have to use a Hypervisor to manage the VM's

Hypervisor
- Name of the software that manages virtual environments on the bare metal computer (VMware, VirtualBox, etc)
- 2 types:
  Type 1: Runs on the bare metal machine. No underlying OS on the machine
  Type 2: Has an OS installed on the baremetal computer, the hypervisor runs inside the OS


containers
- Another layer of abstration above virtual machine
- Share the underlying OS of the machine
- Usually contains only the dependencies
- Each container is isolated from each other
- Advantages: Resource limiting, prioritization (some containers can have more resources than others), Accounting
