Firewalls
Different ways to stop traffic from moving from one part of the network to another
1. Packet filtering - looking for port destination or ip destination or source
2. Stateful filtering - Remembers the parameters going back and forth accross the firewall
3. NGFW - Deep packet inspection, see what apps are running



IDS (Intrusion detection system)
- detects attack
- looks for anomalies or bad protocols or signatures (from TALOS) or reputation


IPS (Intrusion prevention system)
- prevents attack from continuing
